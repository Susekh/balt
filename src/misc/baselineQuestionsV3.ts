            value: `Read the passage and answer the questions that follow on the basis of the information provided in the passage.

Are we alone? The question has tickled the human imagination for years, perhaps ever since our earliest ancestors looked up at the night sky into the endless sea of stars. Is anyone else out there?

Humans do not yet have a definitive answer to the question, but a team of astronomers running computer simulations of planet formation has found that Earth-like planets with enough water to support life could be fairly common.

The team ran 44 simulations of planet formation near a sun and found that each simulation produced one to four terrestrial (rocky, Earth-like) planets, including 11 planets at about the same distance from their stars as Earth is to the sun.

"It's hard to say we sampled exactly the conditions in the galaxy in which terrestrial planets form, but in the cases we chose, an Earth- like planet formed in about a quarter of the cases," said Sean Raymond, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Raymond is the lead author of a paper on the simulations, recently accepted for publication in the astronomy journal Icarus. The co- authors are Thomas Quinn at the University of Washington and Jonathan Lunine at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

The simulations show a wide variety of planets forming; everything from dry planets like Mars, to Earth-like planets, to planets three times as large as Earth with 20 times as much water.

Greg Laughlin, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and expert on planet formation, said he agrees with the interpretation that the universe may be full of a variety of planets, including Earth-like planets with significant water to harbor life.

"There is nothing in our current understanding of planet formation and planetary systems to suggest that the basic architecture of our solar system is particularly unusual", he said.`
