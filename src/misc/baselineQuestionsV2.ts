            value: `Dr Brigid van Wanrooy of the Workplace Research Center at the University of NSW has just released the second Report of a five-year study of 8,000 Australian workers. One of the issues highlighted in the second Report concerns working hours and workload. The research finds that full-time employees work an average of 44 hours per week. More than 29 per cent of the group studied would like to reduce their hours.

The study also found that men tended to work longer full-time hours than women, which is probably explained by the fact that many more women work part-time hours than men.

A disturbing finding was that in households with children, where both couples work, the average combined hours worked per week is 81.

Long working hours are not of themselves harmful provided work-life balance needs are met. In fact, self-employed workers averaged 52 hours a week. The advantage of being self-employed is the sense of ownership and control, which may ameliorate the negative impact of longer hours.

Working longer hours to cope with and/or pay off credit card or mortgage debt can be stressful.
