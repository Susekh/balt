              "An old spectre is haunting Delhi. Abandoned elsewhere in the world by a merciless history, it has taken refuge in a place where there is no Pope or Czar to overcome. Communism, the unraveled lie of the last century, may have lost its original homelands in Russia and Eastern Europe. Doesn't matter, there are always theorists in thrall who can argue with such dialectical conviction about the inevitabilities of scientific error in practice. So, there is always a socialist afterlife beyond the detritus of the Soviet empire and the fallen vassal states. There are also revolutionaries like Prakash Karat armed with the book to guard against the possibility of Marx being exiled to the souvenir shop. Thank God, the revolution of Karat is bound by the armchair. The world as he sees it is a world hostile to the revolutionary ideal, and where counter-revolutionary viruses are on the offensive. He has identified them, and his diktats against them are the most decisive commandments in Indian politics today.\n\nThe word 'Dialectical' in the passage means:",

But most state governments have been tardy in implementing the program. In several states, the midday meals were discontinued in 1997 not because they distracted students and teachers from the task of learning, but actually because the food grains were diverted for other uses and were revived only after the Supreme Court order.\n\nWhy were midday meals discontinued in some states in 1997?',
