            value:`Spring is almost here, but it won't bring a thaw. Neither will summer. If it's going to happen, we'll have to make it happen ourselves.
American businesses and consumers are going virtually nowhere economically. The metaphor we keep hearing is that they're frozen by anxiety over war. Air travel is down because people don't want to get on airplanes. Hotel bookings are down, especially after the feds raised the terror alert level from yellow to orange and specified hotels and apartment buildings as possible targets. Advertisers don't want to advertise on TV during war coverage. Growing companies don't want to do IPOs. Banks don't want to make loans. Result: The icebound economy grows hardly at all, as the latest figures confirm.
The conventional view is that respectable growth will return - the freeze will thaw - once the Iraq situation is resolved. The shooting may have started by the time you read this, though it has not as of press time; in any case, the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield has predicted that the war might take six days or six weeks, but probably not six months. After that, with Saddam- the Iraqi despot- sorted out, we can all get back to spending and investing.
Chances are good, though, that it won't work out quite that way. The conventional view is based (as it often is) on an old model and plenty of hope. The more likely reality is that we're seeing the start of a fundamentally new model of how we live our lives and do business in the U.S.
The old model was formed after the previous Iraq war, won in a few weeks of dazzling high-tech battle, with few U.S. casualties and a relatively clean end. And, oh, what followed almost immediately: The end of a recession, the beginning of the longest continuous economic expansion in our history and the re-launch of the greatest bull market ever. You can't blame anyone for wanting to hug that scenario this time around.

Shoaib, Moin Khan and Abdul Razzaq underwent a series of tests in Lahore on Wednesday. But PCB chief Ramiz Raja said: "The commission has not been constituted to find a scapegoat and punish him."
Shoaib has rubbished the charges and said he had a torn ligament in his back which prevented him from bowling in the final Test. The four-man commission will also look into the injuries of Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul.
The medical commission is expected to submit its report to the PCB by next week.
If found guilty, Shoaib could face a ban and a fine.
Ramiz added: "It has been constituted to find why so many players got injured and what can be done in future to prevent this.
"The other objective is to help the players get their names cleared from the general perception that they faked their injuries, if they were genuinely injured."
"But while saying this, I must make myself very clear that if it was proved some players did fake their injuries, they will be taken to task."
Shoaib reacted strongly to the accusations that his back injury in Rawalpindi was not genuine, despite the fact that he clubbed 28 runs off 14 balls after hurting himself.
"You need the whole body to be perfect when you bowl - it is different when you are batting. I am surprised how someone can think I was not badly injured," he said.
